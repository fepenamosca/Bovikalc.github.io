Modern dairy production systems face challenges to reduce milk production before dry-off and maintain udder health during the dry period. The use of acidogenic boluses represents a novel alternative; however, their impact on udder health has not been investigated. The objective of this trial was to investigate the impact of administering acidogenic boluses at dry-off on the udder health and performance during the next lactation.
